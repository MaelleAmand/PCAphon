## Welcome to the PCA workshop for phonetic research.

Please download the PCAphon workshop package. We will go through the files as we proceed during the workshop.
We will be using several phonetics datasets so that you practice the interpretation of PCA results better.
At the end of the workshop you will:
- have a broad understanding of PCA.
- know the correspondence of PCA key words from one school of PCA to the next to understand results in publications.
- know how to organise your data table to use it for PCA.
- know the main functions of the R package {FactoMineR}.
- know how to interpret PCA graphs and correlation circles.
- find the relevant information in the loadings (PCA output) to answer your research questions.
- know how to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis based on PCA.
