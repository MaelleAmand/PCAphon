# Welcome to the PCA workshop for phonetic research
*Hello, this is Maelle! I'm a lecturer at the University of Paris Sorbonne Nouvelle, professeure agrégée and currently doing and interdisciplinary PhD in sociophonetics & statistics.*

## Aims of the workshop
At the end of the workshop you will:
- have a general **understanding** of PCA
- know the correspondence of **PCA key words** from one school of PCA to the next to **understand results in publications**
- know how to **organise your data table** to use it for PCA
- know the **main functions of the R package {FactoMineR}**
- know how to **interpret PCA graphs and correlation circles**
- find the relevant information in the **loadings (PCA output)** to answer your research questions
- know how to perform a **hierarchical cluster analysis** based on PCA

## Example of your achievement at the end of the workshop:

## Get prepared before the workshop!

Before the workshop, please install the package FactoMineR in RStudio or R on your computer.
It would be advisable to bring your own dataset(s).

## During the workshop

- We will go through the files as we proceed through the workshop. 
- A PCA analysis will be performed on several datasets related to the field of phonetics so that you may improve your interpretation of PCA results and graphs.
- I will also add published articles using PCA analysis for further illustration.
